# Hello bro you are visiting my github homepage now

*I would say something non-esense like " my next nickname would = "PureLov3" ( maybe , haha ) " or so , I am not sure*

**I am a college student from SEU , who majors in Computer Science and I have a fever in Web Security you know : )**

**I am a CTFer ( though I still lack experience , lol , but that would not beeeee a problem )**

**My Plans:**
1. Steganography in Files
2. Web
3. A little misc and pwn
4. Learn Go , then Java
5. Learn Node.js

Maybe that would be my current aims and I would push to thee

## Salute , to you and me .
