# Hello!🥰

**I am a college student from SEU , who majors in Computer Science and I have a fever in Web Security you know : )**

📌**I am a CTFer ( though I still lack experience , lol , but that would not beeeee a problem )**

👍**My Plans:**
* CTF Web and Misc
* Learn Go , then Node.js and Java ( Maybe after a period of time /sad )
* Maybe a css generator?
* 3D graphic process with Python?

## Salute , to you and me .
