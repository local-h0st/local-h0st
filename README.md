# Hello!🥰

*I would say something non-esense like " my next nickname would = "PureLov3" ( maybe , haha ) " or so , I am not sure*

**I am a college student from SEU , who majors in Computer Science and I have a fever in Web Security you know : )**

📌**I am a CTFer ( though I still lack experience , lol , but that would not beeeee a problem )**

👍**My Plans:**
* Nodejs
* CTF Web and Misc
* Learn Go , then Java ( Maybe after a period of time /sad )

**What I've done:**
* Steganography( I have learned LSB in png, but it's a endless process to master it )
* Basic usage of Python

✔️Maybe that would be my current aims and I would push to thee

## Salute , to you and me .
