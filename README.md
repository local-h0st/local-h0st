# Hello!🥰

*I would say something non-esense like " my next nickname would = "PureLov3" ( maybe , haha ) " or so , I am not sure*

**I am a college student from SEU , who majors in Computer Science and I have a fever in Web Security you know : )**

📌**I am a CTFer ( though I still lack experience , lol , but that would not beeeee a problem )**

👍**My Plans:**
1. Steganography in Files!
2. Web and Misc
3. Learning Python( Attention! -ing! )
4. Learn Go , then Java and Node.js( Maybe after a period of time /sad )

✔️Maybe that would be my current aims and I would push to thee

## Salute , to you and me .
